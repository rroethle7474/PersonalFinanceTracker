Option 1 to register service:
# Install the service
sc.exe create "PersonalFinanceTrackerSync" binPath= "C:\path\to\your\PersonalFinanceTracker.SyncService.exe"
sc.exe description "PersonalFinanceTrackerSync" "Synchronizes Personal Finance Tracker data with Salesforce CRM"
sc.exe config "PersonalFinanceTrackerSync" start= auto

# Start the service
sc.exe start "PersonalFinanceTrackerSync"

Option 2 (Preferred using InstallUtil that comes with .NET Framework):
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe C:\path\to\your\PersonalFinanceTracker.SyncService.exe

Installation Process
When you use InstallUtil.exe to install the service, the following happens:

The InstallUtil tool loads your assembly
It finds all classes with the [RunInstaller(true)] attribute
It creates instances of these classes
It calls the Install method on each installer
The installers register the service with the Windows Service Control Manager

Uninstallation Process
Similarly, when uninstalling:

InstallUtil.exe is called with the /u parameter
It finds the installer classes
It calls the Uninstall method on each
The installers remove the service registration from the SCM

How to Manage Windows Services
You can manage all Windows Services (including your newly installed one) through these methods:

Windows Services Manager:

Press Win+R, type services.msc and press Enter
Find your service in the list (it will appear as "Personal Finance Tracker Salesforce Sync")
You can right-click on it to Stop, Start, Pause, or change its properties


Command Line:

Open Command Prompt as Administrator
Use these commands:
Copysc.exe stop "PersonalFinanceTrackerSync"    (to stop it)
sc.exe start "PersonalFinanceTrackerSync"   (to start it)

PowerShell:

Open PowerShell as Administrator
Use these commands:
powershellCopyStop-Service -Name "PersonalFinanceTrackerSync"
Start-Service -Name "PersonalFinanceTrackerSync"

Uninstalling the Service
If you want to completely remove the service from your system:

C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe /u C:\path\to\your\PersonalFinanceTracker.SyncService.exe

Or via command line:
sc.exe delete "PersonalFinanceTrackerSync"

During Development
During development, you have a couple of options:

Don't install the service until you're ready to test it - Just build the project but don't run the InstallUtil command.
Install but keep it in "Manual" start mode - This way it won't run on startup:
csharpCopyStartType = ServiceStartMode.Manual,

Debug Mode - Visual Studio has a special way to debug services without installing them. You can add this method to your service class:

csharpCopy#if DEBUG
internal void DebugStart(string[] args)
{
    OnStart(args);
}
#endif

Console App for testing idea:

static void Main()
{
    #if DEBUG
    var service = new SalesforceSync();
    service.DebugStart(null);
    Console.WriteLine("Service started in debug mode. Press any key to stop.");
    Console.ReadKey();
    service.Stop();
    #else
    ServiceBase[] ServicesToRun = { new SalesforceSync() };
    ServiceBase.Run(ServicesToRun);
    #endif
}
